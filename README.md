# pws
PWS is a personal website project which aims to create an application using spring and react.js displaying my personal CV. The application also accesses a mongodb cluster in order to retrieve necessary portal texts for the website to display in the body. Addiionally, the website supports sending the external emails via Mailtrap.

Currently, the website is under the development and I wish to finish it before november 17th.
